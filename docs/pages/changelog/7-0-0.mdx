## Migration to native CSS

Mantine no longer depends on [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) for styles generation. All `@mantine/*`
packages are now shipped with native CSS files which can be imported from `@mantine/{package}/styles.css`,
for example:

```tsx
import '@mantine/core/styles.css';
```

This change improves performance, reduces bundle size of the library and allows using Mantine
in environments where CSS-in-JS is not supported (or supported with limitations), for example,
Next.js app directory.

Notable breaking changes:

- `createStyles` function is no longer available, use [CSS modules](/styles/css-modules) or any other styling solution of your choice instead
- Components no longer support `sx` prop. You can use `className` or `style` props instead.
- `styles` prop no longer supports nested selectors

It is now recommended to use [CSS modules](/styles/css-modules) to style Mantine components.
To update your project to [CSS modules](/styles/css-modules)
follow the [6.x → 7.x migration guide](/guides/6x-to-7x).

## React 18+ only

Starting from version 7.0 Mantine no longer supports older React versions. Minimum supported version is now React 18.
It is required because Mantine components now use [useId](https://react.dev/reference/react/useId) and [useSyncExternalStore](https://react.dev/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore)
hooks which are available only in React 18.

## Loader changes

[Loader](/core/loader) component is now built with CSS only. This change improves performance and reduces
HTML output of the component.

<Demo data={LoaderDemos.configurator} />

[Theme](/theming/theme-object) object no longer supports `theme.loader` prop –
it is also now possible to add custom loaders on [theme](/theming/theme-object) with [default prop](/theming/default-props).
Specified [Loader](/core/loader) will be used in all components that use it under the hood ([LoadingOverlay](/core/loading-overlay), [Button](/core/button), [ActionIcon](/core/action-icon), [Stepper](/core/stepper), etc.).

<Demo data={LoaderDemos.cssLoader} />

## Table changes

[Table](/core/table) component changes:

- [Styles API](/styles/styles-api) support
- It is now required to use compound components instead of elements: `Table.Tr`, `Table.Td`, etc.

- New props: `borderColor`, `withRowBorders`, `stripedColor`, `highlightOnHoverColor`
