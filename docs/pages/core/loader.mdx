import { Layout } from '@/layout';
import { MDX_DATA } from '@/mdx';
import { LoaderDemos } from '@mantine/demos';

export default Layout(MDX_DATA.Loader);

## Usage

`Loader` component supports 3 types of loaders: `oval`, `bars` and `dots` by default. All
loaders are animated with CSS for better performance.

## Adding custom loaders

`Loader` component is used in other components ([Button](/core/button), [ActionIcon](/core/action-icon), [LoadingOverlay](/core/loading-overlay), etc.).
You can change loader type with [default props](/theming/default-props) by setting `type`.
You can also add custom CSS or SVG loader with `loaders` [default prop](/theming/default-props).

### Custom CSS only loader

Note that in order for `size` and `color` props to work with custom loaders you need to
use `--loader-size` and `--loader-color` CSS variables in your loader styles.

### Custom SVG loader

It is recommended to use CSS only loader as SVG based animations may have the following issues:

- High CPU usage – loader may look glitchy on low-end devices
- Loader animation may not start playing until js is loaded – user may see static loader

In your SVG loader you need to use `--loader-size` and `--loader-color` variables the same
way as in CSS only custom loader in order for `size` and `color` props to work. Usually
you would need to set `width` and `height` to `var(--loader-size)` and `fill`/`stroke` to
`var(--loader-color)`.
