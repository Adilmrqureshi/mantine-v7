import { Layout } from '@/layout';
import { MDX_DATA } from '@/mdx';

export default Layout(MDX_DATA.AppShell);

## Examples

This page includes only documentation. Since all associated `AppShell` components have fixed
position, it is not possible to include demos on this page. You can find 10+ examples on
[this page](/app-shell?e=BasicAppShell)

## Usage

`AppShell` is a layout component. It can be used to implement a common Header – Navbar – Footer – Aside
layout pattern. All `AppShell` components have `position: fixed` style – they are not scrolled with
the page.

[Basic AppShell example](/app-shell?e=BasicAppShell) with header and navbar.
Navbar is hidden on mobile by default and toggled with the burger button.

```tsx
import { useDisclosure } from '@mantine/hooks';
import { AppShell, Burger } from '@mantine/core';

export function BasicAppShell() {
  const [opened, { toggle }] = useDisclosure();

  return (
    <AppShell
      header={{ height: 60 }}
      navbar={{ width: 300, breakpoint: 'sm', collapsed: { mobile: !opened } }}
      padding="md"
    >
      <AppShell.Header>
        <Burger opened={opened} onClick={toggle} hiddenFrom="sm" size="sm" />
        <div>Logo</div>
      </AppShell.Header>

      <AppShell.Navbar p="md">Navbar</AppShell.Navbar>

      <AppShell.Main>Main</AppShell.Main>
    </AppShell>
  );
}
```

## Configuration

`AppShell` component accepts, `header`, `footer`, `navbar` and `footer` props to configure
corresponding sections. It is required to set these props if you want to use corresponding
components. For example, if you want to use `AppShell.Header` component, you need to set `header`
prop on the `AppShell` component.

`header` and `footer` configuration objects are the same and have the following properties:

```tsx
interface Configuration {
  /** Height of the section: number, string or
   ** object with breakpoints as keys and height as value */
  height: AppShellSize | AppShellResponsiveSize;

  /** If section is collapsed,
   ** it is hidden from the viewport and is not offset in AppShell.Main */
  collapsed?: boolean;

  /** Determines whether the section should be offset by the AppShell.Main.
   ** For example, it is useful if you want to
   ** hide header based on the scroll position. */
  offset?: boolean;
}
```

`navbar` and `aside` configuration objects are the same as well and have the following properties:

```tsx
interface Configuration {
  /** Width of the section: number, string or
   ** object with breakpoints as keys and width as value */
  width: AppShellSize | AppShellResponsiveSize;

  /** Breakpoint at which section should switch to mobile mode
   ** In mobile mode the section always has 100% width and its
   ** collapsed state is controlled by the `collapsed.mobile`
   ** instead of `collapsed.desktop` */
  breakpoint: MantineBreakpoint | (string & {}) | number;

  /** Determines whether the section should be collapsed */
  collapsed?: { desktop?: boolean; mobile?: boolean };
}
```

## Height configuration

`height` property in `header` and `footer` configuration objects works the following way:

- If you pass a number, the value will be converted to [rem](/styles/rem) and used as
  height at all viewport sizes.
- To change height based on viewport width, use object with breakpoints as keys and height as
  values. It works the same way as [style props](/styles/style-props#responsive-styles).

Examples:

```tsx
import { AppShell } from '@mantine/core';

// Height is a number, it will be converted to rem
// and used as height at all viewport sizes
function Demo() {
  return (
    <AppShell header={{ height: 48 }}>
      <AppShell.Header>Header</AppShell.Header>
    </AppShell>
  );
}
```

```tsx
import { AppShell } from '@mantine/core';

// Height is an object with breakpoints:
// - height is 48 when viewport width is < theme.breakpoints.sm
// - height is 60 when viewport width is >= theme.breakpoints.sm and < theme.breakpoints.lg
// - height is 76 when viewport width is >= theme.breakpoints.lg
function Demo() {
  return (
    <AppShell header={{ height: { base: 48, sm: 60, lg: 76 } }}>
      <AppShell.Header>Header</AppShell.Header>
    </AppShell>
  );
}
```

## Width configuration

`width` property in `navbar` and `aside` configuration objects works the following way:

- If you pass a number, the value will be converted to [rem](/styles/rem) and used as
  width when the viewport is larger than `breakpoint`.
- To change width based on viewport width, use object with breakpoints as keys and width as
  values. It works the same way as [style props](/styles/style-props#responsive-styles).
  Note that width is always 100% when the viewport is smaller than `breakpoint`.

Examples:

```tsx
import { AppShell } from '@mantine/core';

// Width is a number, it will be converted to rem
// and used as width when viewport is larger than theme.breakpoints.sm
function Demo() {
  return (
    <AppShell navbar={{ width: 48, breakpoint: 'sm' }}>
      <AppShell.Navbar>Navbar</AppShell.Navbar>
    </AppShell>
  );
}
```

```tsx
import { AppShell } from '@mantine/core';

// Width is an object with breakpoints:
// - width is 100% when viewport width is < theme.breakpoints.sm
// - width is 200 when viewport width is >= theme.breakpoints.sm and < theme.breakpoints.lg
// - width is 300 when viewport width is >= theme.breakpoints.lg
function Demo() {
  return (
    <AppShell navbar={{ width: { sm: 200, lg: 300 }, breakpoint: 'sm' }}>
      <AppShell.Navbar>Navbar</AppShell.Navbar>
    </AppShell>
  );
}
```

## padding prop

`padding` prop controls the padding of the `AppShell.Main` component. It is important to use it
instead of setting padding on the `AppShell.Main` directly because padding of the `AppShell.Main` is
also used to offset `AppShell.Header`, `AppShell.Navbar`, `AppShell.Aside` and `AppShell.Footer` components.

`padding` prop works the same way as [style props](/styles/style-props#responsive-styles) and
accepts numbers, strings and objects with breakpoints as keys and padding as values. You can
reference `theme.spacing` values or use any valid CSS values.

```tsx
import { AppShell } from '@mantine/core';

// Padding is always theme.spacing.md
function Demo() {
  return <AppShell padding="md">{/* AppShell content */}</AppShell>;
}
```

```tsx
import { AppShell } from '@mantine/core';

// Padding is:
// - 10 when viewport width is < theme.breakpoints.sm
// - 15 when viewport width is >= theme.breakpoints.sm and < theme.breakpoints.lg
// - theme.spacing.xl when viewport width is >= theme.breakpoints.lg
function Demo() {
  return <AppShell padding={{ base: 10, sm: 15, lg: 'xl' }}>{/* AppShell content */}</AppShell>;
}
```

## withBorder prop

`withBorder` prop is available on `AppShell` and associated sections: `AppShell.Header`, `AppShell.Navbar`, `AppShell.Aside` and `AppShell.Footer`.
By default, `withBorder` prop is `true` – all components have a border on the side that is adjacent to the `AppShell.Main` component.
For example, `AppShell.Header` is located at the top of the page – it has a border on the bottom side,
`AppShell.Navbar` is located on the left side of the page – it has a border on the right side.

To remove the border from all components, set `withBorder={false}` on the `AppShell`:

```tsx
import { AppShell } from '@mantine/core';

// None of the components will have a border
function Demo() {
  return <AppShell withBorder={false}>{/* AppShell content */}</AppShell>;
}
```

To remove the border from a specific component, set `withBorder={false}` on that component:

```tsx
import { AppShell } from '@mantine/core';

// AppShell.Header does not have a border
// AppShell.Navbar and AppShell.Aside have a border
function Demo() {
  return (
    <AppShell>
      <AppShell.Header withBorder={false}>Header</AppShell.Header>
      <AppShell.Navbar>Navbar</AppShell.Navbar>
      <AppShell.Aside>Aside</AppShell.Aside>
    </AppShell>
  );
}
```

## zIndex prop

`zIndex` prop is available on `AppShell` and associated sections: `AppShell.Header`, `AppShell.Navbar`, `AppShell.Aside` and `AppShell.Footer`.
By default, all sections `z-index` is `200`.

To change `z-index` of all sections, set `zIndex` prop on the `AppShell`:

```tsx
import { AppShell } from '@mantine/core';

// All sections will have z-index of 100
function Demo() {
  return <AppShell zIndex={100}>{/* AppShell content */}</AppShell>;
}
```

To change `z-index` of a specific section, set `zIndex` prop on that section:

```tsx
import { AppShell } from '@mantine/core';

// AppShell.Header has z-index of 100
// AppShell.Navbar and AppShell.Aside have z-index of 300
function Demo() {
  return (
    <AppShell>
      <AppShell.Header zIndex={100}>Header</AppShell.Header>
      <AppShell.Navbar zIndex={300}>Navbar</AppShell.Navbar>
      <AppShell.Aside zIndex={300}>Aside</AppShell.Aside>
    </AppShell>
  );
}
```
