## Theme properties

### focusRing

`theme.focusRing` controls focus ring styles, it supports the following values:

- `auto` (default and recommended) – focus ring is visible only when user navigates with keyboard, this is default browser behavior for native interactive elements
- `always` – focus ring is visible when user navigates with keyboard and mouse, for example, focus ring will be visible when user clicks on button
- `never` – focus ring is always hidden, it is not recommended – users who navigate with keyboard will not have visual indication of current focused element

<Demo data={ThemingDemos.focusRing} />

### focusClassName

`theme.focusClassName` is a CSS class that is added to elements that have focus styles, for example, [Button](/core/button) or [ActionIcon](/core/action-icon/).
It can be used to customize focus ring styles of all interactive components except inputs. Note that when `theme.focusClassName` is set, `theme.focusRing` is ignored.

> **:focus-visible selector**
>
> `:focus-visible` selector is supported by more than [91% of browsers](https://caniuse.com/css-focus-visible) (data from April 2023).
> Safari browsers added support for it in version 15.4 (released in March 2022). If you need to support Safari 15.3 and older, you can use [focus-visible polyfill](https://github.com/WICG/focus-visible)
> or provide a [fallback](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-visible#providing_a_focus_fallback) with `:focus` pseudo-class.
