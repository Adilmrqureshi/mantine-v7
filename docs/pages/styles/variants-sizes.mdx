# Variants and sizes

## Adding custom variants

Most of Mantine components support `variant` prop, it can be used in CSS variables resolver
and it is also exposed as `data-variant="{value}"` attribute on the root element of the component.
The easiest way to add custom variants is to add styles that use `[data-variant="{value}"]`.

Example of adding new variant to [Input](/core/input) component:

- `underline` variant styles are added
- `filled` variant is a default variant – you do not need to define any additional styles for it

<Demo data={StylesDemos.customVariant} />

Note that you can add custom variants to every Mantine component that supports [Styles API](/styles/api)
even if there are no variants defined on the library side.

> **Overriding existing variants styles**
>
> Apart from adding new variants you can also override existing ones, for example you can change
> `filled` variant of [Input](/core/input) component with `.input[data-variant="filled"]` selector.

## variantColorResolver

[Button](/core/button), [Badge](/core/badge), [ActionIcon](/core/action-icon) and [ThemeIcon](/core/theme-icon)
components support custom variants with [variantColorResolver](/theming/colors#colors-variant-resolver)
– it supports both changing colors and adding new variants. Note that `theme.variantColorResolver` is
responsible only for colors, if you need to change other properties, use `data-variant` attribute.

<Demo data={ThemingDemos.variantColorsResolver} />

## Sizes with components CSS variables

You can add custom sizes to any component that supports `size` prop by providing a custom
CSS variables resolver, usually it is done in `theme.components`:

<Demo data={StylesDemos.vars} />

## Sizes with data-size attribute

Every component that supports `size` prop exposes it as `data-size="{value}"` attribute on root element.
You can use it to add custom sizes:

<Demo data={StylesDemos.dataSize} />
